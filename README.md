# IoT Project of Automated Plant-Watering System (Controller part)

## Required hardware components:

- An ESP32 microcontroller
- An 18650 lithium-ion battery
- A capacitive soil moisture sensor v.1.2
- An air temperature and humidity sensor ASAIR DHT11
- A 5V mini-water pump
- An ARCELI water-level sensor
- Diodes, transmitters and resistors

The prototype uses an ESP32 development board with 18650 lithium-ion battery, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, temperature and humidity DHT-11 sensors, a 5V water pump, and an LED indicator. The sensor connects to the ESP32â€™s analogue input. The pump is controlled via a transistor. The ESP32 runs a program that reads the sensor, compares the value to a threshold, and activates the pump if needed. The LED is connected to a digital output and lights up when the water tank is low.

## System requirements

## Quick start

Controller connects to the WIFI on start. Find the IP address of device in WIFI settings, the Tasmota Web UI will be served on this IP.

## TODO:

-	Develop a mobile application for easier on-the-go access and real-time notifications
-	Apply multiple zones 
-	Design and develop an ergonomic enclosure
-	Expand the smart learning algorithm 
-	Integratesolar power support
-	Add automatic tank refill functionality
-	Enhancethe reliability of hardware components
